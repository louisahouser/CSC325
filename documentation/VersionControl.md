## Source Code Version Control Tools

### Introduction

Though sometimes referred to as source control, version control is a mechanism to keep revision history that is easy to revert or reference back to. It is a tool, and a strong one at that, providing developers with the chance to keep anything and everything in version control for reliable retrieval later.

Through using version control, many advantages are presented:

1. Previously released versions can be deployed into an environment to find a defect.
2. In the case of an application catastrophe, a successful, previously released version can be deployed to production again until the disaster has been managed.
3. Previous versions of an application can be viewed to ensure newer versions have improved or changed.
4. Notification to developers of any inadvertent change to the application.
5. Continuous integration becomes finitely more accessible and well, less scary.
6. Deployment and configuration processes can be compeletly automated and stored in version control
7. Changes made can be deployed to any and all environments seamlessly.
8. Due to all 7 advantages above, collaboration becomes easier and more reliable. Rather than wonder who made what change, version control has the history labeled with time and collaborator.

Overall, version control provides an incredible sense of control over the configuration and deployment process. 

### Version Control System Used

The version control system chosen for this project is Git. This system was primarily chosen over others due to its easy integration with VS Code, and open-source software.

### Repository Setup

### Common Commands and Usage

Changes should be made in the version control system, and then implemented to the production system through the automated pipeline. 

Changes should be committed frequently, and branching should be left avoided.
