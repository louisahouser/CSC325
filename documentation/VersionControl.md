## Source Code Version Control Tools

### Introduction

Through using version control, many advantagious options are available:

1. Previously released versions can be deployed into an environment to find a defect.
2. In the case of an application catastrophe, a successful, previously released version can be deployed to production again until the disaster has been managed.
3. Previous versions of an application can be viewed to ensure newer versions have improved or changed.

Overall, there is an incredible sense of control over the deployment
