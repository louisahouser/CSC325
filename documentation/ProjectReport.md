## **Project Report**:  Building a CI/CD Pipeline for a Flutter Application

### Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines serve companies the ability to fully automate the build, test, and deployment phases with not only increased efficiency, but security as well. If a release is deployed and found defective in some way, the delivery team is able to safely revert to a previous version in order to preserve stability for users and the development team, until they are ready to redeploy the release. This feature is primarily through the implementation of version control, a pivotal aspect of the pipeline. Every commit made to the application triggers tests and other runs to be performed automatically, providing feedback at each step regardless of pass or fail as can be seen in figure 1. Furthermore, this provides ability for developers to work in teams with reliable work logs as well as the ability for work to be done simultaneously without affecting stable versions. The goal of building such a pipeline is to have the entire process automated, however, it provides the flexibility to slowly build up to it. This means not only is it great for companies but it is also beneficial for those wanting to ease deployment for individual projects.  

### DevContainer Environment

The DevContainer was created to prevent the common issue of, "Well it works on my computer." By using this, the application runs regardless of environment, completely standardizing it for every user. For this project, Docker, an open-platform was used, which runs packages inside containers. Visual Studio Code is the IDE used, where the .devcontainer, which uses Ubuntu, and DockerFile were built on, which, through using provides complete customability. Not only are all of the tools and dependencies installed for the developer, but certain features such as the Flutter SDK were able to be selected to be installed as well, cutting down manual labor and time.
